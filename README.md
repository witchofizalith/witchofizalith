- I’m @witchofizalith, a neuroscientist. 
- My research interests are in the studying prefrontal calcium dynamics of the neural circuitry underlying affective regulation and the ability to discriminate between safety and danger.
- I’m currently learning (more) R & Python, and how to apply these languages to the study of the brain. 
- You can reach me @magalhaesneuro on twitter!
