- I’m @witchofizalith, a post-bacc neuroscience research assistant. 
- My research interests are in the study of the neural mechanisms underlying memory, learning, & anxiety disorders.
- I’m currently learning (more) R & Python, and how to apply these languages to the study of the brain and memory. 
- I would like to learn more about computational neuroscience & data science! I come from a statistical heavy research background, where I created statistical models predicting PTSD symptom severity.
- You can reach me @magalhaesneuro on twitter!
